# Privacy Policy for SnowTracks

**Last updated:** January 14, 2026

## 1. Introduction
SnowTracks ("we", "our", "the app") is a mobile application designed to help users record and review ski and snowboard sessions using the device’s GPS. This Privacy Policy explains what data SnowTracks collects, how it is used, and your rights. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## 2. Data Collection
SnowTracks prioritizes user privacy by keeping data local. We collect the following:
- **Precise Location Data:** GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, and timestamps captured while a session is being recorded. This includes data captured in the foreground and background (if permissions are granted) to ensure your track is not interrupted when the screen is off.
- **Local Session Data:** Statistics derived from your movements (runs, distances, speeds, ascent/vertical) and raw GPS track points. This data is stored strictly in a local SQLite database on your device.
- **Exported Backups:** When you choose to export a backup, the app generates a JSON file. This file is saved to your device's storage or shared via the system share sheet only at your explicit request.

**Note for v1.0:** The app does not automatically upload location or session data to any external servers or third-party cloud services.

## 3. How We Use Your Data
The collected data is used exclusively to:
- Provide core app functionality: recording sessions, automatic run detection, and map visualization.
- Generate session statistics and allow offline access to your activity history.
- Facilitate user-initiated exports (JSON backups).
- **SnowTracks does not use your data for advertising, tracking, or profiling.**

## 4. Data Sharing & Third Parties
- **User-Initiated Sharing:** You have full control over your data. Sharing only occurs when you explicitly use the "Export" or "Share" features. In these cases, the file is handled by the destination app you choose.
- **No Automatic Sharing:** We do not share your data with third parties, data brokers, or advertisers.

## 5. Data Retention & Deletion
- Your data remains on your device until you delete specific sessions within the app, clear the app's cache/storage in your device settings, or uninstall the app.
- Because there are no central servers for version 1.0, we cannot "remotely" delete your data; you maintain full custody of your records.

## 6. Security
We follow industry-standard security practices for mobile development. Your data is stored locally using SQLite. Please ensure your device is secured with a passcode or biometric lock to protect the data stored on the physical hardware.

## 7. Permissions
To function correctly, SnowTracks requires the following permissions:
- **Android:** `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, and `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`.
- **iOS:** `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` and `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`.
The app displays a persistent notification while recording in the background to ensure transparency.

## 8. Children's Privacy
SnowTracks is not targeted at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

## 9. Legal Bases (GDPR/CCPA)
For users in the EU/EEA or jurisdictions with similar privacy laws (like CCPA):
- The legal basis for processing location data is **Consent**, which you provide via the system permission prompts.
- You have the right to access, export, or delete your data at any time via the app’s interface.

## 10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as SnowTracks evolves. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page will reflect the most recent changes.
